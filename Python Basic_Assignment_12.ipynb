       "'Sample Five-Paragraph Examples Essay (on failure preceding success)\\nÒFailure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently,Ó wrote Henry Ford. People are \\nconstantly shaped and influenced by their experiences. People learn by doing. Often, people learn considerably \\nmore from their mistakes than their success. For proof of failure driving success, consider examples from both \\nscience and art, including Thomas Edison, Vincent Van Gogh, and Stephen King. \\nThe famed inventor, Thomas Edison, rose to prominence in the late 19th century because of his successes, but \\neven he felt that these successes were the result of many failures. He did not succeed in his work on one of his \\nmost famous inventions, the lightbulb, on his first try nor even on his hundred and first try. In fact, it took him \\nmore than 1,000 attempts to make the first incandescent bulb but, along the way, he learned quite a lot. As he \\nsaid, ÒI did not fail a thousand times but instead succeeded in finding a thousand ways it would not work.Ó \\nThus, Edison demonstrated both in thought and action how instructive mistakes can be. \\nThe road to contemporary success for the 19\\nth century artist Vincent van Gogh was even more dramatically \\npaved with failure. In current day, van Gogh is considered one of the most celebrated painters of all time. \\nHowever, during his lifetime, he was considered a disappointment. In current day, his paintings can sell for \\nmillions of dollars, but he struggled to sell his paintings when he was alive. He even took to burning several of \\nhis paintings because they would not sell. \\nThe 20\\nth century writer Stephen King, author of novels that were turned into popular movies (e.g., \\nStand by Me\\n and \\nThe Shawshank Redemption\\n) also experienced failure. When he wrote his first novel, \\nCarrie\\n, he was \\nteaching school in rural Maine. Although he had previously had limited success in selling his short stories, it \\ntook him 30 attempts to get Carrie published. He almost threw away the manuscript, but his wife pulled it out \\nfrom the trash and encouraged him to try again. It is hard to imagine Stephen King ever felt that defeated, isnÕt \\nit?Thomas Edison, Vincent van Gogh, and Stephen King demonstrate, in both science and art, that failure more \\noften than not precedes success. Whenever we learn a new skill - be it riding a bike, driving a car, or cooking a \\ncake - we learn from our mistakes. Few, if any of us, are ready to go from training wheels to a marathon in a \\nsingle day but these early experiences (these so-called mistakes) can help us improve our performance over \\ntime. You cannot make a cake without breaking a few eggs and, likewise, we learn by doing and doing \\ninevitably means making mistakes. If we treat failure not as a misstep but as a learning experience the \\npossibilities for self-improvement are limitless. \\nModified from \\nEssay Writing Tips\\n (https://www.internationalstudent.com/essay_writing/essay_tips/\\n) and \\nDevelop Good Habits (\\nhttps://www.developgoodhabits.com/successful-people-failed\\n)5'"
